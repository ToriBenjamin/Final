  <p> Going forward can be a challenging start, but fear not! Take a look around you, and think "Hey, I wonder what [insert random object] would look like if it were a person?" Then BOOM. You got inspired! Start creating, there's never a wrong answer to what you make. </p>

  <p>Don't stress about making something perfect when you first start. Many characters, even ones that I'm definitely sure you've heard of during your lifetime, have gone through many changes and redesigns in the past.</p>

  <p>It's totally okay to want to change the look of your character! Sketch out your first ideas and you can always go back and revise them. Even a simple color palette change may work. Many characters have years' worth of redesigns, so don't stress!</p>

    <p> The whole point of creating characters is to have fun with them! If you post your content publicly then no matter what you're sure to find someone or an audience that enjoys your work. Don't worry!</p>
