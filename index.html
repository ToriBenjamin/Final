    <h4>Origins</h4>
    <p> People started creating original characters that could explore the human experience and make engaging stories.

      <p> Researching the creator of the popular cartoon <i>Spongebob Squarepants</i>, Stephen Hillenburg, helped me to learn how he came up with the idea for the show and the characters. As he was developing the show's concept, Hillenburg remembered his teaching experience at the Orange County Marine Institute and how mesmerized children were by tide-pool animals, including crabs, octopuses, starfish, Cyclops copepod and sponges. It came to him that the series should take place underwater, with a focus on those creatures: "I wanted to create a small town underwater where the characters were more like us than like fish. They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, "something that was fantastic but believable."
